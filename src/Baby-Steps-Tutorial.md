# 🌟 Baby Steps: From Figma Design to Live Website! 🌟

*A super simple tutorial for little builders (and their grown-up helpers!)*

---

## 🎯 What We're Going to Do

We're going to take your beautiful React design (like the Gallagher Art School one you have) and make it into a **real website** that anyone in the world can visit! 

Think of it like building with blocks - we already built something amazing, now we're going to put it in a special place where everyone can see it! 🏗️

---

## 🧸 Step 1: Make Sure Everything Works

**What to do:** Test your React app like a toy before giving it to friends!

1. **Open your computer** 💻
2. **Look at your app** - does it work when you click buttons?
3. **Try it on a phone size** - make the window very skinny like a phone
4. **Try it on a big screen** - make the window very wide like a TV

**✅ Success means:** Everything looks pretty and works when you click it!

---

## 🎨 Step 2: Build Your Website Files

**What to do:** Turn your React code into website files

1. **Open your terminal** (that black window with text)
2. **Type this magic spell:** `npm run build`
3. **Wait for it to finish** (like waiting for cookies to bake) 🍪
4. **Look for a new folder called `dist`** - this has your website files!

**✅ Success means:** You see a `dist` folder appear with lots of files inside!
